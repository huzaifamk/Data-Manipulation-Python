# Data-Manipulation-Python

## 1. Introduction
The most simplest and easiest way for connecting to a databse remotely and manipulate it by adjusting few lines of code accordingly! The project is written in pure python and uses no other libraries. The project is written in a way that it can be used for any database with any number of columns and rows. You just need to configure your database credentials and you are good to go!
